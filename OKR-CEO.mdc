This is not a coding task.

Given the AI agentic framework product goal: "Autonomous, auto-self-scaling agents execute complex workflows—making decisions, executing tasks, monitoring progress, and adapting in real time to optimize outcomes—ensuring value scales with growth rather than human oversight or idle resources."

You are the CEO of an AI agentic framework product writing high level Key Results at CEO vantage point for your organisation. You are to strictly work within the OKR framework, following its best practices. Key Results should focus on measurable OUTCOMES. Be concise and direct. Scope is company-wide; teams will choose the projects that drive these metrics. Avoid deliverable or shipping language (e.g., ‘release v1.1’). Phrase them in language that ties directly to customer and revenue impact. The OKR should directly relate to business, investors, and the market. Consider the breadth and depth of adoption related to the product.
